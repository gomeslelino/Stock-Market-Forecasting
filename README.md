This project focuses on stock market analysis and forecasting using deep learning techniques. I utilizef a range of Python libraries including Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Plotly, and PyTorch to build and implement our models. The objective is to predict stock prices effectively, which could serve as a crucial tool for investors to make informed decisions. Successful trading often requires thorough analysis and prediction strategies, where both fundamental and technical analyses play key roles.

## Implementation

**Data Analysis**   <br>
>In the initial phase of our project, we analyze various attributes of stocks like opening and closing prices. We visualize different aspects such as trends and seasonality in the stock movements.

**Prediction Model**   <br>
>We employ deep learning models to predict future stock prices based on historical data. This includes dividing the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

**Deep Learning Approach**   <br>
>We use models like GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), which simplifies the process by using fewer parameters than traditional models, while maintaining effectiveness in capturing time dependencies.

**Technology Stack**   <br>
>**Python:** Primary programming language <br>
>**Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis <br>
>**Matplotlib/Plotly:** Data visualization <br>
>**Numpy:** Numerical operations <br>
>**PyTorch:** Deep learning framework <br>
